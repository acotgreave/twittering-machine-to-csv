get-tweets

Well this little tool was designed to pull twitters from the SEARCH api and
append those twitters to a CSV file (if the CSV file exists). The csv file
that is written to is named by the actual search string passed, so;

 get-tweets.py #test 10

will write a csv file named #test.csv of up to 10 pages of twitter results.
The 10 is not required, and the default is 50 (the maximum number of pages
can be up to 150).

It also does a couple of other things, the tool also will sort the CSV
file and make sure that it is not appending duplicate columns. It will
also split the location (or flatten it if you will) so that the location
information will show up in the row well.

A couple of things to note, the delim is '|', which when it is found
in the text file will replace it. Also all " are replaced with ', which
seems to cause less headaches when parsing. All of the \n \rn are removed
and the string from the text is stripped down.

And yes, it is a unicode encoded CSV file, which is still a CSV file.

In order to run this script, please use Python25 or greater and run
the setup.bat tool to install the non-standard modules, which are just;
 - simplejson
