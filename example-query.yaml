# test query yaml
#   this YAML is broken into three parts;
#    1. the query, which is the actual query requested by the tool
#    2. the output, defines the output file for the queries and results.
#    3. the configs, which define the configurations for the tool, like
#       number of pages to grab, timeouts, etc.

# queries to run against the query API, which are listed
# here.
query:
    - #test
    - @test
    - test

output:
    # The name of the output CSV file that will be created.
    name: test-results.csv

configs:
    # maximum number of pages to grab, the maximum is 150 (if there are actually
    # 150 pages of history available)
    pages   : 20

    # number of attempts to make before giving up, when getting access denied
    # from the API
    attempts: 10

    # time to wait between attempts, when getting access denied from
    # the twitter api (which can happen when you have requested  to many
    # rows)
    wait    : 5

    # datetimes strings are dependant on the computer's locale, so different
    # datetie formats might be needed depending on where the tool is executed
    # from.
    # The datetime format is Pythonic and the formats can be found at:
    #   http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
    format  : '%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S'

    # NOTE: for a format in, say London, where the 2 digit month and 2 digit day might
    # might be interpretted differently by JET, the following datetime format
    # is recommended (uncomment to use)
    #format  : '%b-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S'
