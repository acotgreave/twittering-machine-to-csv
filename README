get-tweets

Well, this is iteration 2 of this tool, and I have made some significant
changes to the tool, those changes are;
1. Read twitter queries from a YAML, so that the user can also provide
   some other settings (see the example-query.yaml).
2. Fixed some unicode issues, but not all of them
3. Quoting csv columns instead with text, which is much more useful than
   stripping text strings and trying using '|' as the delimiter
4. Query is now added to the CSV file, whose name is defined in the YAML,
   as a column (and the default is to lowercase the query). This means that
   there will be duplicate Twitter IDs if that tweet had was found in
   multiple searches.
5. CSV file is created as twitter data is retrieved.

Also, as mentioned in the 'example-query.yaml', the datetime string format
can be intepretted differently based on the local of your computer. For example,
the datetime format (which is Python's datetime format), for somewhere like Seattle
would be;
  '%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S' which translates to 06-11-2012 14:21:53 (which is June 11th sometime)
does not translate well for London, which 06 and 11 might either be a month or a
day. So the following would be better:
  '%b-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S', which translates to 'Jun-11-2012 14:21:53'

The Pythonic formats can be found at:
